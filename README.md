# Nogi-Blog-Backend

[NodeJS - Blog API Project - The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-blog-api)

This is one of the NodeJS projects under the Fullstack Javascript Development curriculum for The Odin Project. The purpose of this project was to build a blog API with a frontend component. The application should allow users to view and post comments on blog posts. Another frontend is to be set up to allow logging in and creating/editing blog posts.

This repository is for the backend/API side of the blog application.
